# Train Ticket Management System

This is a simple **Train Ticket Management System** built using Python and Streamlit. The application allows users to:

- **Book Train Tickets**: Passengers can select a train, travel date, and have a seat randomly assigned to them.
- **View Booked Tickets**: See a list of all booked tickets.
- **Cancel Tickets**: Cancel a booked ticket using its unique ticket ID.

---

## **Features**
- **Random Seat Allocation**: Ensures no two passengers get the same seat for the same train and travel date.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built using Streamlit for a seamless and interactive experience.
- **SQLite Database**: Stores ticket details persistently for retrieval and management.
